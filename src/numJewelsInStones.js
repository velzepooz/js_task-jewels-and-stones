 * You're given 2 strings:

 *
 * You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

 * Example 1:
 * Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
 * Output: 0
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - stones and jewels will contain only letters and have length at most 50.
 *  - The characters in jewels are unique.
 *  - "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A"
